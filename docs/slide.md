# So, what?

When: discoverd in 2016, notified vendors at July 14, 2017, publish in Public at Oct 16, 2017

Who: Mathy Vanhoef (Belgain Researcher)

What: protocol design flaw (WPA2 four-way handshakes) + software bug (linux based systems)

How: reinstall an already-in-use key by manipulating and replaying handshake messages

Target: Any device that uses Wi-Fi is likely vulnerable (mostly Linux, Android, and OpenBSD)

# Details

- WPA2 4-way handshake to negotiate a shared key with router

- Key + nonces are used for encrypting packets

- How it is used depends on the actual crypto algorithm being used

- Crypto attack if certain valuers are reused 

- KRACK: force reusing same values

- Software bug was found in some linux based systems 

- Key reset to all zero: 00000000000

---
![handshake](../resources/pics/handshake.png)

- PTK: Pairwise Transient Key
- PTK is generated by concatenating PMK(password), AP nonce(ANonce), STA nonce(SNonce), AP MAC address, and STA MAC address.
---
# Attacks that can be made

- Adversary can decrypt arbitrary packets.
    * This allows an adversary to obtain the TCP sequence numbers of a connection, and hijack TCP connections.

- Adversary can replay broadcast and multicast frames.

- Adversary can both decrypt and inject arbitrary packets. (TKIP or GCMP ONLY)

- Adversary can force the client into using a predictable all-zero encryption key. (ANDROID 6.0+ and LINUX)

---
# Attacks that cannot be made

- Adversary can not recover WPA password.

- Adversary can not inject packets. (AES-CCMP ONLY)

---

# Bad News

- The attack works for both clients and access points

- Attacks against Android 6.0+ devices are very easy to accomplish

- Updates may never come for many IoT devices

- Change Wi-Fi password will not save you

---

# Good News

- Attacker must be within WiFi network range

---

# What you can do ?

1. Check with device vendor if the patch is available

2. Patch all the devices that are able to be patched: router, mobiles, laptop, IoT devices etc.

3. If patch is not available, replace wireless connections with either wired connections or cellular connection

4. Replace all devices that cannot be patched

5. Place devices on separate, restricted subnets/networks/VLANs and place devices on dedicated wireless networks; then, enforce different access controls per subnet

6. Always only visit website with HTTPS

---

### What I learn ?

- Curiosity, Critical thinking, source code reading

- How to prevent these types of bugs: "Need more rigorous inspections of protocol implementations"
